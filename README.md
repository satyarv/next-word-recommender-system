# ðŸ”¤ Next Word Recommender System using Trigram Language Model

This project implements a **Next Word Prediction System** using an **N-Gram Language Model** trained on a custom dialogue dataset. It predicts the most likely next word given two previous words, making it useful for applications like auto-complete or smart typing assistance.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build a word recommendation system that:
- Cleans and tokenizes sentences
- Creates unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
- Trains a trigram-based probability model
- Suggests the next word based on previous two words

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter / Colab)
- pandas
- NumPy
- re (regex for text cleaning)
- tqdm (for progress bars)
- collections (defaultdict for model building)
